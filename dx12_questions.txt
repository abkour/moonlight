Why can arrays not be mapped to 32-bit constants in the root signature?

What exactly is a root signature?
	The root signature defines the parameters that are used to bind resources to the 
	shaders. Arguments are passed to the root signature via the command list.

What exactly is a command allocator, and how does it interact with command lists?
	The principle is simple I think. Command lists require memory to store their commands. 
	This memory is allocated and freed by the command allocator. Simple as that.
	However, I don't know where the memory is exactly and how and when it is reallocated.
	The memory is on the CPU, and presumably managed by the driver.

	There is the Reset() function that allows reuse of the already allocated memory.
	This indicates that a command allocator never shrinks in size, but instead keeps growing.

	This is my understanding as of now.

	Appendum: It seems that the command list contains the buffer in which the commands are recorded.
	If that is the case, the command buffer is allocated by the command allocator.
	A call to CommandAllocator->Reset() would then do either of two things:
		1. Set the command buffer to nullptr, but maintain the buffer storage
		2. ...

Detail how CPU/GPU synchronization works!

Is the SV_Position specifier similar in intended use as the gl_Position variable in GLSL?

What exactly is a Pipeline State Object (PSO)?

What are the differences among committed, placed and reserved resources?
