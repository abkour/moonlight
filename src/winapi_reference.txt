Macros:

void IID_PPV_ARGS(ppType)

    This function retrieves an interface pointer, based on the type of the associated IID of the supplied 
    interface pointer.
    This works, because the type is known at compile time.
    Avoids having to call QueryInterface on the ComPtr, which can lead to errors if the wrong interface
    identifier is supplied.
